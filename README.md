AeroGear TODO Application
=========================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/TODO.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/TODO)

What is it?
-----------

The _AeroGear TODO Application_ currently contains one client project, a web application which is already optimized for mobile! In the future it will contain different client projects for iOS, Android or Apache Cordova..

The project also contains a server side project, which offers several REST / JAX-RS endpoints.

System requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven
3.0 or better.

The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss AS 7 or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.

An HTML5 compatible browser such as Chrome, Safari 5+, Firefox 5+, or IE 9+ are
required. 

Mobile web support is limited to Android and iOS devices.  It should run on HP,
and Black Berry devices as well.  Windows Phone, and others will be supported as 
jQuery Mobile announces support.
 
With the prerequisites out of the way, you're ready to build and deploy.

System requirements
-------------------

This application make use of PicketBox "timed releases" hosted on JBoss Maven repository, follow the configuration instructions [here](https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenSettings) for getting PicketBox dependencies working with our TODO application.

To build the projects simply run the following command from the root directory:

    mvn clean install

This will build the _ear_ file with:
- the web application (_todo-www.war_)
- the REST endpoints (_todo-server.war_)

The application will be automaticaly deployed to **$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments**

Starting the server
-------------------------

Once you have done that, you need to start the JBoss container. To do this, run
  
    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
  
or if you are using windows
 
    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.bat
    
Note: Adding "-b 0.0.0.0" to the above commands will allow external clients (phones, tablets, 
desktops, etc...) connect through your local network.
      
For example

    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 

The client application will be running at the following URL <http://localhost:8080/todo-www/>.a
